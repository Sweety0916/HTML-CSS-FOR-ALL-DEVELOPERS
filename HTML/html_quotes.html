HTML <address> for Contact Information
    The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.
    
    The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.
    
    The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element.

        HTML <cite> for Work Title
            The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).
            
            Note: A person's name is not the title of a work.
            
            The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic.
