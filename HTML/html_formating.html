HTML Formatting Elements
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text
<small> - Smaller text
<del> - Deleted text
<ins> - Inserted text
<sub> - Subscript text
<sup> - Superscript text


HTML <b> and <strong> Elements
The HTML <b> element defines bold text, without any extra importance.

The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.

Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.


HTML <address> for Contact Information
    The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.
    
    The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.
    
    The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element.
